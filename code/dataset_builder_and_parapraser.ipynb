       "['Learn with a community. I’ve personally found that I’ve developed new and existing skills much faster (by a magnitude of months) when I’ve joined a community of learners than when I was trying to learn the same skills alone. By attending local and online user groups, conferences, and other events, you can discover new concepts, hone new skills, and network with possible future colleagues. Also, in a community, you will gain a more holistic perspective of information security and a more complete picture of how others are managing successful information security programs. Learn the fundamentals of effective communication. Although an emphasis is often placed on learning the technical skills necessary to succeed in information security, you also need to bring a similar level of intensity to improving your communication skills.',\n",
       " 'Understanding how to secure a network or be in compliance with a privacy regulation is just as important as understanding how to communicate reports on these technical responsibilities to diverse audiences. Information security is a shared responsibility among every member of an organization, so the real impact of an information security professional’s work depends on how well other people can understand their reports and make informed decisions to improve their security program. Learn concepts hands\\\\-on, as it’s the best way to grow and progress your information security skills. Participating in a CTF (capture the flag) or completing a basic project (e.g., securing a WiFi router) for a relative or friend and writing about your experience is often much better than only reading through abstract concepts in textbooks or certification exam study guides.',\n",
       " 'Your experience using real\\\\-world tools is just as necessary as your experience studying for academic credentials and certifications, as it translates theoretical ideas into practical outcomes. Learn how to ask the right questions. By far, the most challenging aspect of any profession to learn is the intuition for what questions there are to ask and which questions you should ask. The more experience you have and the more you engage your intellectual curiosity, the easier it will be to ask the right questions. Developing information security literacy, or knowing how to find the answers to these questions, can be achieved through risk assessment and mitigation education and practice. By following this framework, you will be able to not only keep up with the most up\\\\-to\\\\-date information and protect against the most advanced current threats, but you will also have an enhanced ability to protect against future threats facing tomorrow’s technology.']"

The last bit is equally important. How does this relate to cybersecurity?

In many organizations, asset management is viewed as pure drudgery and a never\\\\-ending stretch to accomplish. Assets residing on your network, not just those dedicated to your employees but perhaps your supporting third parties as well, are not static entities. Today’s asset inventory is almost guaranteed to look a little different than yesterday’s. Much like Sisyphus pushing the boulder almost to the top of the mountain every day, your asset management goal posts can and will change daily.'}]}},\n",

I’m sure you’ve heard “people are the weakest link in security” multiple times. That thinking is counterproductive.

And one of the most important tools in preventing cyberattacks is encouraging user adoption of proper cyber hygiene and security tools. This makes clear that the actions of people are at the core of the challenges and the solutions, which is why understanding the user and meeting them where they are is foundational to better security outcomes.

With the introduction of the internet, the most significant threats no longer came from floppy disks but outside sources; this means that security teams have had to create and adapt their patterns continuously, for example, filtering and blocking external traffic with a firewall, sanitizing it, and then letting the traffic live in the internal DMZ (demilitarized zone).'}]}},\n",

Protecting the triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability forms the basic tenets of InfoSec. Keeping the information confidential, accurate, and available is the norm we aspire to. You will need to know what normal looks like when it comes to network protocols, computer operations, application behavior, and even the traffic flow in your corporate environment. An attack will affect what is normal. Think of the attack as the anomaly in your setup. All detection tools rely on having specifications on what is considered unusual or not normal. Think of the signatures or rules from your IPS (intrusion prevention system) and anti\\\\-malware platforms that will alert upon a match on malicious activity.'}]}},\n",

As of 2020, we have seen an explosion in the number of certifications. A few organizations are fighting hard to get the top spot and the industry recognition and money that come with them. Certifications have also become the ultimate gate for hiring managers. A few letters in your resume can make the difference between whether it gets read or not, leaving a lot of people who cannot afford certifications behind.'}]}},\n",

If you get to talk to people from countries where getting a US$1,000 certification represents an annual salary, you will quickly understand the issue. People coming from privileged backgrounds can boast about “trying harder“ while the rest feel left out. Content sharing in our industry allows anyone to get from zero to hero on their own. Even if you cannot afford training, you can get most ingredients and the recipes. There is no secret sauce. Training platforms are just a catalyst in your learning journey. On the other end, you just cannot get certified unless you pay the price.'}]}},\n",

It’s more than just having tools in place and running scans. Vulnerability management is the cyclical process of identifying, categorizing, prioritizing, remediating, and mitigating software vulnerabilities. For new organizations and old ones referencing the CIS Top 20 Basic Security Controls, you see that VM is the third control on that list after identifying all your assets and software. This means, before any penetration testing or implementation of other controls, you MUST identify your systems and the vulnerabilities first. This will drive the rest of your controls as you are able to see what is critical and what should be remediated or mitigated to improve your security posture.'}]}},\n",

Common cloud models include software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). By moving computing resources to a cloud provider, significant amounts of money, energy, and resources are saved while allowing computing resources to be scalable as well as available on demand; this is known as elasticity. In 2020, at the height of the COVID\\\\-19 pandemic, the global workforce shifted to remote work, accelerating migrations to the cloud.

However, when they attempted to do so, the software gave an error: `Invalid password : [P@55w0rd!]`, which ultimately ended up in the error logs.

Threat management can be considered the hub of the cybersecurity organization, because whether you’re preparing for, understanding, or responding to threats, the vantage point of the group allows for it to inform and be informed by all other areas of cybersecurity. As we all know, threats will always exist, but how we manage them is crucial to effectively de\\\\-risking the business. The standards for an incident response capability are widely known—see the NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide; however, the way in which these standards are developed, executed, and evolved vary by organization. Incident response is a discipline that is largely qualifiable and not always quantifiable. Using the known phases of incident response—preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post\\\\-incident activity—incident responders should ask themselves, can I quantify the end of each phase?'}]}},\n",

The definition of information security is the process or practices that are created and implemented to protect all information systems platforms, no matter the form or classification level, from unauthorized access, disruption, modification, disclosure, deletion, or destruction. One area of compliance can be establishing a compliance program that institutes risk\\\\-based controls that protect the CIA (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) of all data stored, processed, and transferred.

How did this even happen? And what does this mean for your BI organization? When we look back to the beginning of the first era of decision support systems in the 1970s, we see technical systems used by IT experts to get insights from small (by today’s scale) datasets. These systems evolved and eventually became known as BI in the late 1980s. Analyzing data was new, so even the most basic insights seemed jaw\\\\-dropping. Suddenly, decisions were no longer based on gut instinct, but on actual data that enabled safer and bolder decisions in complex business scenarios.'}]}},\n",

If you ask 10 people, you will probably get 11 answers. For the course of this book, it is important to have a common understanding of what this term actually means. Let’s first acknowledge that the term artificial intelligence is not new. In fact, the term dates back to military research labs in the 1950s. Since then, researchers have tried many approaches to accomplish the goal of having computers or machines replicate human intelligence. As Figure\\xa01\\\\-7 shows, two broad fields of AI have emerged since its inception: general AI and narrow AI.'}]}},\n",

ML is a programming paradigm that aims to find patterns in data for a specific purpose. ML typically has two phases: learning (training) and inference (also called testing or prediction). The core idea behind ML is that we find patterns in historical data to solve a specific task, such as putting observations into categories, scoring probabilities, or finding similarities between items. A typical use case for ML is to analyze historical customer transaction data to calculate individual probabilities of customer churn. With inference, our goal is to calculate a prediction for a new data point given everything that we learned from the historical data.'}]}},\n",

Instead of hardcoding rules into a system, you present enough examples of inputs and desired outputs (labels) and let the ML algorithm come up with the rule set for you. While this setup is ineffective for building a customer support system, it works great for certain scenarios where the rules are not known or are hard to describe. For example, if you want to prioritize customer support tickets based on a variety of features such as the ticket text, customer type, and ticket creation date, an ML algorithm could come up with a prioritization model for you just by looking at how past tickets have been prioritized. Instead of handcrafting a complicated if\\\\-then\\\\-else logic, the ML algorithm will figure it out, given a certain amount of computation time and computational resources.'}]}},\n",

Iterate if necessary. Job done. The main difference in AI projects is that—even under ideal circumstances—the outcome is highly uncertain.

Then they find that the projects turn out to be a bottomless pit. Months of work and thousands of dollars are spent just to get to a simple result: it doesn’t work. Prototyping is a way to minimize risk and evaluate the impact and feasibility of your ML use case before scaling it. With prototyping, your ML projects will be faster, cheaper, and deliver a higher return on investment. For this book, a prototype is an unfinished product with a simple purpose: validation. Concepts such as a PoC or a minimum viable product (MVP) serve the same purpose, but these concepts have a different background and involve more than just validation. The idea of validation is so important because you don’t need to build a prototype if you don’t have anything to validate.'}]}},\n",

However, the problem with test systems is that they often involve the same technical effort and challenges as the production system.

Like any variable, it could take on different values (United States, Finland, and so forth), but we aren’t able to make quantitative comparisons between them (what is two times Indonesia, anyone?).

However, using the principles of probability introduced in Chapter\\xa02, we can quantify our uncertainty that what we see in our sample will also be found in the population.'}]}},\n",

On the other hand, as open source tools R and Python are free, and include many app\\\\-like features called packages that serve nearly any use case. This environment will allow you to focus on the conceptual analysis of your data rather than raw computation, but you will need to learn how to program. These tools, and the analytics toolkit in general, will be the focus of Chapter\\xa05.'}]}},\n",

Unlike R, which was designed explicitly for data analysis, Python was developed as a general\\\\-purpose language meant to do things like interact with operating systems, handle processing errors, and so forth. This has some important implications for how Python “thinks” and works with data. For example, you saw in Chapter\\xa07 that R has a built\\\\-in tabular data structure.

Can’t wait to visit again!”). Some reviews might be mixed—for example, “The burger was great but the fries were soggy”—so we use the probability that the label is a 1 as a sentiment score.

Their purpose is to provide insights into existing data, or to group data into categories and categorize future inputs accordingly. A classic example of unsupervised learning is inspecting records regarding products purchased from your company and the customers who purchased them to determine which customers might be most interested in a new product you are launching and then building a marketing campaign that targets those customers. A spam filter is a supervised learning model. It requires labeled data. A model that segments customers based on incomes, credit scores, and purchasing history is an unsupervised learning model, and the data that it consumes doesn’t have to be labeled.

To demonstrate how sentiment analysis works, let’s build a binary classification model and train it with this dataset. We’ll use logistic regression as the learning algorithm.

Analysis reveals that 5% of the spam emails you receive contain the word congratulations, but just 1% of all your emails contain the same word.

Embedded carbon, often referred to as embodied carbon, is the carbon emitted during the creation and eventual destruction of a piece of equipment. In 2019, Apple reported that 85% of the lifetime carbon emissions associated with an iPhone occur during the production and disposal phases of the device.

Operational efficiency is about achieving the same output with fewer machines and resources. This can potentially cut carbon emissions five to tenfold and is comparatively straightforward because, as we will discuss later, services and tools already exist to support operational efficiency, particularly in the cloud.

We need to run systems at higher utilization for processors, memory, disk space, and networking. This is also called operating at high server density, and it improves both energy and hardware efficiency. A good example of it can be seen in the work Google has done over the past 15 years to improve its internal system utilization. Using job encapsulation via containerization, together with detailed task labeling and a tool called a cluster scheduler, Google tightly packs its various workloads onto servers like pieces in a game of Tetris. The result is that Google uses far less hardware and power (possibly less than a third of what it would otherwise).'}]}},\n",

However, the trouble with code efficiency is it can run smack up against something most businesses care a great deal about: developer productivity. And they are correct to care about that. We agree that operational efficiency is less effective than code efficiency, but it has a significant advantage for most enterprises. For comparatively low effort and using off\\\\-the\\\\-shelf tools, you can get big improvements in it. It’s much lower\\\\-hanging fruit, and it’s where most of us need to start. Code efficiency is amazing, but its downside is that it is also highly effortful and too often highly customized (hopefully, that is something that’s being addressed, but we’re not there yet).

There are loads of names for the idea, and we’ve probably missed some, but the motive behind them all is the same. Machine utilization is about cramming work onto a single machine or a cluster in such a way as to maximize the use of physical resources like CPU, memory, network bandwidth, disk I/O, and power. Great machine utilization is at least as fundamental to being green as code efficiency. For example, let’s say you rewrite your application in C and cut its CPU requirements by 99%. Hurray! That was painful, and it took months. Hypothetically, you now run it on exactly the same server you did before. Unfortunately, all that rewriting effort wouldn’t have saved you that much electricity. As we will discuss in Chapter\\xa06, a partially used machine consumes a large proportion of the electricity of a fully utilized one, and the embodied carbon hit from the hardware is the same.'}]}},\n",

Rightsizing techniques can be applied both on prem and in the cloud.

That should at least ensure it doesn’t run up against resource limitations. It also reduces the chance of hard\\\\-to\\\\-debug race conditions. Yes, it’ll cost a bit more money, but your service is less likely to fall over, and for most businesses, that trade\\\\-off is a no brainer.

The trouble is, in practice, autoscaling can hit issues similar to manual overprovisioning. Scaling up to the maximum is fine, but scaling down again is a lot riskier and scarier, so sometimes it isn’t configured to happen automatically. You can scale down again manually, but who has the time to do anything manual? That was why you were using autoscaling in the first place.

Burstable instances offer a compromise between resilience and greenness.

Burstable instances come with a baseline level of CPU performance, but, when the workload demands, can “burst” to a higher level for a limited period.

The performance of burstable instances can be variable, making it difficult to predict the exact level you will get.

Most cluster schedulers offer similar functionality, so the likelihood is you’ll use the one that comes with the operational platform you have selected—it is unlikely to be a differentiator that makes you choose one platform over another. However, the lack of such machine utilization functionality might indicate the platform you are on is not green enough.'}]}},\n",

That’s fine. The concept remains the same. However, all this clever tech still runs up against the need for information. When a scheduler understands the workloads it is scheduling, it can use resources more effectively. If it’s in the dark, it can’t do a good job. For Kubernetes, the scheduler can act based on the constraints specified in the workload’s pod definition, particularly the CPU and memory requests (minima) and limits (maxima), but that means you need to specify them. The trouble is, that can be tricky.'}]}},\n",

Unfortunately, this means it is less effective—or even completely ineffective—for smaller setups like running Kubernetes on prem for a handful of nodes or for a couple of dedicated VMs in the cloud. However, it can be great for hyperscalers. They have a wide range of jobs to juggle to achieve optimum packing, and in part, that explains the high server utilization rates they report. The utilization percentages that AWS throws about imply that AWS requires less than a quarter of the hardware you’d use on prem for the same work. The true numbers are hard to come by, but AWS’s figure is more than plausible (it’s likely an underestimate of AWS’s potential savings).'}]}},\n",

As a result, the easiest sustainability step you can take is often to move your systems to the cloud and use their services well, including the full range of instance types. It’s only by using their optimized services and schedulers that you can get those numbers. Don’t lift and shift onto dedicated servers and expect much green value, even if you’re using Kubernetes like a pro. As we’ve said before, scale and efficiency go hand in hand. Hyperscalers can invest the whopping engineering effort to be hyperefficient because it is their primary business. If your company is selling insurance, you will never have the financial incentive to build a hyperefficient on\\\\-prem server room, even if that were possible.

You can put your job in a spot instance, and it may be completed or it may not. If you keep trying, it will probably be done at some point, with no guarantee of when. In other words, the jobs need to be very time shiftable. In return for this laissez faire approach to scheduling, users get 90% off the standard price for hosting.'}]}},\n",

If all your tenants were ecommerce retailers, they would all want more resources on Black Friday and in the run\\\\-up to Christmas. They would also all want to process more requests in the evenings and at lunchtime (peak home shopping time). Correlated demand like that is bad for utilization.'}]}},\n",

Going green without destroying developer productivity is about choosing green platforms. To survive the energy transition, we reckon everything is going to have to become a thousand times more carbon efficient through a combination of, initially, operational efficiency and demand shifting and, eventually, code efficiency, all achieved using green platforms.

Graphs have come to underpin everything from consumer\\\\-facing systems like navigation and social networks to critical infrastructure like supply chains and power grids. These important graph use cases have reached a common conclusion: applying knowledge in context is the most powerful tool that most businesses have. A set of patterns and practices called knowledge graphs has been emerging to help understand data in context, where the context is represented as a graph of connected data items. With knowledge graphs, there is hope that you can distill business value from data. This book is an attempt to show how it can be done.'}]}},\n",

Some models allow relationships to be directed, where they have an explicit start and end node, while some have undirected relationships connecting nodes. Some models, like hypergraphs, allow relationships to connect multiple nodes. In theory, there’s no single best graph model to choose (though you can usually transform from one model to another). But there are better or worse models in practice, especially for building computer systems. In this book we’ve chosen the labeled property graph model as the foundation. It’s a popular model that is simple for software and data professionals to understand.

Relationships cannot “dangle”; they always have a start node and an end node, even if the start and end nodes are the same. For instance, there is a `Person` node with the property `name:'Rosa'` that has an outgoing `LIVES_IN` relationship with the property `since: 2020` to the `Place` node with the property `city:'Berlin'`. You can read this as “Rosa has lived in Berlin since 2020,” based on the direction of the relationships. You can also see that `Fred` is a `FRIEND` of `Karl` and that `Karl` is a `FRIEND` of `Fred`. `Rosa` and `Karl` are also friends, but `Rosa` and `Fred` are not.\"}]}},\n",

Some nodes are densely connected while others are sparsely connected. All that matters is that the model matches the problem domain. Similarly, some nodes have lots of properties, while some have few or none. Some relationships have lots of properties, but many have none at all. This is all perfectly normal for knowledge graphs. It’s easy to see how the graph in Figure\\xa01\\\\-3 can answer questions about friendships and who lives where. Extending the model to include other data like hobbies, publications, or jobs is also straightforward: just keep adding nodes and relationships to match your problem domain.

But clearly not all graphs are knowledge graphs (despite the hype). Knowledge graphs are a specific type of graph with an emphasis on contextual understanding. Knowledge graphs are interlinked sets of facts that describe real\\\\-world entities, events, or things and their interrelations in a human\\\\- and machine\\\\-understandable format. Critically, knowledge graphs must have an organizing principle so that a user (or a computer system) can reason about the underlying data. The organizing principle provides an additional layer of structure that adds context to support knowledge discovery. The organizing principle makes the data itself smarter. This idea runs contrary to the norm where intelligence resides in applications and data is dumb, just something to be mined and refined. Having smarter data both simplifies systems and encourages broad reuse.'}]}},\n",

In principle, knowledge graphs are agnostic about the physical storage of the underlying data.

These range from client\\\\-side database drivers, (custom) functions and procedures, and APIs to streaming middleware and finally ETL (extract, transform, load) tools.

Its official documentation can be found on the JAX website. JAX is a framework for writing mathematical code in Python that is just\\\\-in\\\\-time (JIT) compiled. JIT compilation allows the same code to run on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. This makes it easy to write performant code that takes advantage of the parallel\\\\-processing power of vector processors. Additionally, one of the design philosophies of JAX is to support tensors and gradients as core concepts, making it an ideal tool for ML systems that utilize gradient\\\\-based learning on tensor\\\\-shaped data. The easiest way to play with JAX is probably via Google Colab, which is a hosted Python notebook on the web.'}]}},\n",

We import JAX’s version of NumPy as `jnp` to distinguish it from NumPy (`np`) by convention so that we know which version of a mathematical function we want to use. This is because sometimes we might want to run code on a vector processor like a GPU or TPU that we can use JAX for, or we might prefer to run some code on a CPU in NumPy. The first point to notice is that JAX arrays have types. The typical float type is `float32`, which uses 32 bits to represent a floating\\\\-point number. Other types exist, such as `float64`, which has greater precision, and `float16`, which is a half\\\\-precision type that usually only runs on some GPUs.'}]}},\n",

It is really important to pay attention to “JAX—The Sharp Bits” to understand these differences. JAX’s philosophy is about speed and purity. By making functions pure (without side effects) and by making data immutable, JAX is able to make some guarantees to the underlying accelerated linear algebra (XLA) library that it uses to talk to GPUs. JAX guarantees that these functions applied to data can be run in parallel and have deterministic results without side effects, and thus XLA is able to compile these functions and make them run much faster than if they were run just on NumPy.'}]}},\n",

In general, the notation follows a `start:end:stride` convention. The first element indicates where to start, the second indicates where to end (but not inclusive), and the stride indicates the number of elements to skip over. The syntax is similar to that of the Python `range` function. Slicing allows us to access views of a tensor elegantly. Slicing and indexing are important skills to master, especially when we start to manipulate tensors in batches, which we typically do to make the most use of acceleration hardware.'}]}},\n",

We just split a key into as many parallel operations as needed, and the random numbers resulting are now randomly distributed but also reproducible.

It’s important to understand these ideas as they lead to pathological behavior in recommendation systems and motivate many architectural decisions. We’ll start by discussing the shape of data you often see in recommendation systems, and why that shape can require careful thought. Next we’ll talk about the underlying mathematical idea, similarity, that drives most modern recommendation systems.

Industrial scale in our context will primarily refer to reasonable scale (a term introduced by Ciro Greco, Andrea Polonioli, and Jacopo Tagliabue in “ML and MLOps at a Reasonable Scale”)—production applications for companies with tens to hundreds of engineers working on the product, not thousands. In theory, a recommendation system is a collection of math formulas that can take historical data about user\\\\-item interactions and return probability estimates for a user\\\\-item\\\\-pair’s affinity. In practice, a recommendation system is 5, 10, or maybe 20 software systems, communicating in real time and working with limited information, restricted item availability, and perpetually out\\\\-of\\\\-sample behavior, all to ensure that the user sees something.'}]}},\n",

Batch processes often include tasks like training a model on historical data, augmenting one dataset with an additional collection of features, or transforming computationally expensive data. Another characteristic you see more frequently in batch processes is that they work with the full relevant dataset involved, not only an instance of the data sliced by time or otherwise. A real\\\\-time process is carried out at the time of the request; said differently, it is evaluated during the inference process. Examples include providing a recommendation upon page load, updating the next episode after the user finishes the last, and re\\\\-ranking recommendations after one has been marked not interesting. Real\\\\-time processes are often resource constrained because of the need for rapidity, but like many things in this domain, as the world’s computational resources expand, we change the definition of resource constrained.'}]}},\n",

An oversimplification of this process would be to use a few features of the request to quickly select subsets of all possible candidates.

The online ranker first does filtering, utilizing the filtering infrastructure built offline—for example, an index lookup or a bloom filter application. After filtering, the number of candidate recommendations has been tamed, and thus we can actually come to the most infamous of the tasks: rank recommendations. In the online ranking phase, usually a feature store is accessed to take the candidates and embellish them with the necessary details, and then a scoring and ranking model is applied. Scoring or ranking may happen in several independent dimensions and then be collated into one final ranking. In the multiobjective paradigm, you may have several of these ranks associated with the list of candidates returned by a ranker.'}]}},\n",

The combination of the data flow and the jointly available data for learning is called the architecture. More formally, the architecture is the connections and interactions of the system or network of services; for data applications, the architecture also includes the available features and objective functions for each subsystem. Defining the architecture typically involves identifying components or individual services, defining the relationships and dependencies among those components, and specifying the protocols or interfaces through which they will communicate.'}]}},\n",

Diversity not only safeguards against overspecialization but also promotes novel and serendipitous discoveries, enriching the overall user experience. The balance between relevance and diversity is delicate and can be tricky. This balance challenges the algorithm to go beyond merely echoing users’ past behavior and encourages an exploration of new territories, hopefully providing a more holistically positive experience with the content.'}]}},\n",

In computer science terminology, when you try to rank every item in a corpus one by one, the typical amount of time it would take if there are N items is proportional to N. This is called big O notation. So if you have a user vector and you have a corpus of N items, it would take typically O(N) time to score all the items in the corpus for one user. This is usually tractable if N is small and can fit into GPU RAM, typically N \\\\< 1 million items or so. However, if we have a very large corpus of, say, a billion items, it might take a very long time if we also have to make recommendations for a billion users. Then in big O notation it would be O(1018) dot products to score a billion items for each and every one of a billion users.'}]}},\n",

Let’s look at an example to distinguish the two. Your video\\\\-streaming website knows that you’ve previously seen all of Darren Aronofsky’s films, so when The Whale is released, the website is very likely to recommend it. But this type of recommendation is different from one you might receive after finishing episode 10 of Succession. You may have been watching Aronofsky films over a long time period—Pi many years ago and Black Swan earlier this year. But you have been watching an episode of Succession each night this week, and your entire recent history is made up of Logan Roy. This latter example is a sequential recommendation problem: using the most recent ordered list of interactions to predict what you’ll enjoy next.'}]}},\n",

In this chapter, we’ll briefly introduce some of the modern views of where recommendation systems are going. An important point to consider is that recommendation systems as a science spread both depth first and breadth first simultaneously. Looking at the most cutting\\\\-edge research in the field means that you’re seeing deep optimization in areas that have been under study for decades or areas that seem like pure fantasy for now.'}]}},\n",

The business managed to go on without finding or building a solution to solve the problem until a potential customer asked for very specific information about the team’s experience and the organization could not easily provide it.

These tools are commonly referred to as low\\\\-code/no\\\\-code technologies. Microsoft 365 provides a collection of apps that fall into this category of low\\\\-code/no\\\\-code, and the core ones include Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, Power Virtual Agents, and Power Pages.

A project may have one or more frontend and backend developers, project managers, business analysts, and database administrators. Projects can also include UI/UX designers, QA testers, and possibly a DevOps team to help build automated deployment processes designed to get you through the development, quality assurance, and production deployments.

Businesses are built on systems and repeatable processes that undergo continuous improvement as they grow. Let’s take an example of a small business that starts with simple processes like manually filling out invoices and sending an email to request an approval before sending an invoice. As the business grows and the number of invoices and approvals grows, the possibility of errors increases. Errors could be things like adding the wrong amount to the invoice. Maybe the business adds rules saying that if the invoice reaches a certain dollar amount, extra approvals are needed. Those types of errors could damage a business’s revenue and reputation.'}]}},\n",

In fact, you can incrementally add to these solutions and solve your problems as you go, in the same way that your business incrementally refined its onboarding process as the years went by. For example, with the Power Platform, you may begin with a workflow that will automate sending those previously manual emails to key people, informing them of their HR tasks when a key piece of information is uploaded to SharePoint. Next, you may create an app that collects relevant information about the new hire, like the equipment that needs to be ordered for them.

We want to be able to capture the skills of more than one person, so the Employee Skills table will capture similar data to that of our first Power App (created at the end of Chapter\\xa03): skills, proficiency ratings, and any notes that we want to include about a specific skill. Our original app was intended for just a single person to use, so there wasn’t any validation and the skills were entered manually. This meant nothing would stop you from entering the same information multiple times. For example, you could enter SharePoint, Sharepoint, and sharepoint, and they would all be recorded as individual items.'}]}},\n",

We have quite a bit of control over how a canvas app is laid out. Model\\\\-driven apps take a different approach. They focus on the data first and depend on Dataverse, whereas canvas apps work with a variety of data sources including Dataverse. With model\\\\-driven apps, you focus on the tables, the forms, and the views, and those will drive your user experience. Because you won’t be focusing on creating screens, input controls, buttons, navigation controls, and more, your app’s interface can be created faster than with a canvas app. Model\\\\-driven apps limit how much control you have over the look and feel, but this allows you to be hyperfocused on what’s most important: the data.'}]}},\n",

I can open my photo app right now and type in “baby,” and the app will filter and show me all of the photos that I’ve taken of my three\\\\-year\\\\-old since she was born. Similarly, you can add an image to a PowerPoint presentation, and PowerPoint will use AI to automatically caption that image.

It shifts the burden away from runtime unit tests onto the compiler to verify that all the types in a program fit together correctly. This makes large programs much easier to manage, more predictable, and more robust. Furthermore, static typing allows tools such as IntelliSense in Visual Studio to help you write a program, because it knows for a given variable what type it is, and hence what methods you can call on that variable. Such tools can also identify everywhere in your program that a variable, type, or method is used, allowing for reliable refactoring.'}]}},\n",

WinRT assemblies also ship with rich metadata in .winmd files, which have the same format as .NET assembly files, allowing transparent consumption without special ritual; this is why you might be unaware that you’re using WinRT rather than .NET types, aside from namespace differences. Another clue is that WinRT types are subject to COM\\\\-style restrictions; for instance, they offer limited support for inheritance and generics.'}]}},\n",

The C\\\\# 3\\\\.0 features added to support LINQ comprised implicitly typed local variables, anonymous types, object initializers, lambda expressions, extension methods, query expressions, and expression trees. Implicitly typed local variables (`var` keyword, Chapter\\xa02) let you omit the variable type in a declaration statement, allowing the compiler to infer it. This reduces clutter as well as allowing anonymous types (Chapter\\xa04), which are simple classes created on the fly that are commonly used in the final output of LINQ queries.

It also cannot generalize to functions that are not methods, such as operators (e.g., the division operator) or properties.

Forgetting to test for the magic value results in an incorrect value that might go unnoticed until later in execution—when it pulls an unintended magic trick. Forgetting to test `HasValue` on a null value, however, throws an `Invalid\\u200bOperationException` on the spot. The ability for a value to be null is not captured in the type.

This extensibility is useful for services that integrate deeply into the type system, without requiring special keywords or constructs in the C\\\\# language.

At runtime, if a dynamic object implements `IDynamicMetaObjectProvider`, that interface is used to perform the binding.

However, in each of the three uncallable scenarios, an additional type is involved, which is known only at compile time. As of this writing, there’s no way to specify these additional types dynamically. When calling extension methods, that additional type is implicit. It’s the static class on which the extension method is defined. The compiler searches for it given the `using` directives in your source code. This makes extension methods compile\\\\-time\\\\-only concepts because `using` directives melt away upon compilation (after they’ve done their job in the binding process in mapping simple names to namespace\\\\-qualified names).'}]}},\n",

To meet this requirement, .NET Core provides a set of facilities to log diagnostic information, monitor application behavior, detect runtime errors, and integrate with debugging tools if available. Some diagnostic tools and APIs are Windows specific because they rely on features of the Windows operating system. In an effort to prevent platform\\\\-specific APIs from cluttering .NET Core, Microsoft has shipped them in separate NuGet packages that you can optionally reference.

Your own programs can also take advantage of this metadata and even extend it with new information using custom attributes. The `System.Reflection` namespace houses the reflection API.

A system can be considered to be scalable if it doesn’t need to be refactored to perform its intended function during or after a steep increase in demand. Because unscalable services can seem to function perfectly well under initial conditions, scalability isn’t always a primary consideration during service design. While this might be fine in the short term, services that aren’t capable of growing much beyond their original expectations also have a limited lifetime value. What’s more, it’s often fiendishly difficult to refactor a service for scalability, so building with it in mind can save both time and money in the long run.'}]}},\n",

If you want to split hairs, then sure, to a point. But how scalable is it? Vertical scaling is inherently limited by the size of available computing resources, so a service that can only be scaled up isn’t very scalable at all. If you want to be able to scale by ten times, or a hundred, or a thousand, your service really has to be horizontally scalable.'}]}},\n",

Errors have the potential to cause a system to fail to perform its required function: a failure.

You can’t prevent every possible fault, and it’s wasteful and unproductive to try. However, by assuming that all of a system’s components are certain to fail—which they are—and designing them to respond to potential faults and limit the effects of failures, you can produce a system that’s functionally healthy even when some of its components are not. There are many ways of designing a system for resiliency. Deploying redundant components is perhaps the most common approach, but that also assumes that a fault won’t affect all components of the same type. Circuit breakers and retry logic can be included to prevent failures from propagating between components. Faulty components can even be reaped—or can intentionally fail—to benefit the larger system.'}]}},\n",

Like the electrical switch from which this pattern derives its name, `Breaker` has two possible states: closed and open. In the closed state everything is functioning normally. All requests received from the client by `Breaker` are forwarded unchanged to `Circuit`, and all responses from `Circuit` are forwarded back to the client. In the open state, `Breaker` doesn’t forward requests to `Circuit`. Instead it “fails fast” by responding with an informative error message.'}]}},\n",

Most implementations of Circuit Breaker include some logic to automatically close the circuit after some period of time. Keep in mind, though, that hammering an already malfunctioning service with lots of retries can cause its own problems, so it’s standard to include some kind of backoff, logic that reduces the rate of retries over time. The subject of backoff is actually fairly nuanced, but it will be covered in detail in in “Play It Again: Retrying Requests”.'}]}},\n",

If that value meets the failure threshold, then it returns the error “service unreachable” without actually calling `circuit`. Any successful calls to `circuit` cause `consecutiveFailures` to reset to 0, and the cycle begins again. The closure even includes an automatic reset mechanism that allows requests to call `circuit` again after several seconds, with an exponential backoff in which the durations of the delays between retries roughly doubles with each attempt. Though simple and quite common, this actually isn’t the ideal backoff algorithm. We’ll review exactly why in “Backoff Algorithms”.'}]}},\n",

These can be caused by any number of (hopefully) temporary conditions, especially if the downstream service or network resource has protective strategies in place, such as throttling that temporarily rejects requests under high workload, or adaptive strategies like autoscaling that can add capacity when needed. These faults typically resolve themselves after a bit of time, so repeating the request after a reasonable delay is likely (but not guaranteed) to be successful. Failing to account for transient faults can lead to a system that’s unnecessarily brittle. On the other hand, implementing an automatic retry strategy can considerably improve the stability of the service that can benefit both it and its upstream consumers.'}]}},\n",

The Retry function accepts the user\\\\-defined Effector function and returns an Effector function that wraps the user\\\\-defined function to provide the retry logic.

What’s more, when using channels in this way, functions with more than one return value will usually assign a dedicated channel to each member of the return list, which can become awkward as the return list grows or when the values need to be read by more than one goroutine. The Future pattern contains this complexity by encapsulating it in an API that provides the consumer with a simple interface whose method can be called normally, blocking all calling routines until all of its results are resolved.

In actuality, when SlowFunction is called, it executes the core function of interest as a goroutine. In doing so, it defines channels to capture the core function’s output, which it wraps in InnerFuture. InnerFuture has one or more methods that satisfy the Future interface, which retrieve the values returned by the core function from the channels, cache them, and return them.

However, because locks allow access to only one process at a time, the average amount of time spent waiting for locks to clear in a read/write intensive application can increase dramatically with the number of concurrent processes acting on the resource. The resulting lock contention can potentially bottleneck key functionality.

The sociologist Stuart Hall describes this process in his classic work “Encoding and Decoding in the Television Discourse”. Hall describes how these concepts work in television media; you can apply a similar approach to your own communications. However you want to communicate with others, you are choosing how to take the information you have and share it. The method that you use to share it will require you to encode your thoughts. Therefore, your audience will need to decode the message to understand exactly what you meant.'}]}},\n",

Receiver and destination In organizational communication, your receiver is likely to be the destination. You have probably learned which methods of communication are particularly effective for the people you work with. For example, if you send emails to your boss constantly but get no response, you will probably stop sending them and look for another method. Perhaps you will start by speaking to your boss directly. Direct conversation is a much easier way to ensure that your message is received, because you witness it happening—well, most of the time.'}]}},\n",

Simply, we can’t, especially when working across different organizations or locations. The rise in remote working during the COVID\\\\-19 pandemic has shown the importance of in\\\\-person communication and how much harder it is to be heard remotely. After all, in a digital world you can’t just walk over to someone’s desk to ensure that the receiver gets the message you want them to. Video conferencing can help resolve some of those challenges.

The 2D position is created by using two axes, one vertical and another horizontal. Comparing two metrics against one another is a common task in data analysis.

Even though York has a similar sales variance to Leeds, having the bars start at the same place makes it much easier to spot the difference and interpret the chart. In short, even when you’re using pre\\\\-attentive attributes well, you still need to take care that the chart conveys the information clearly, that you’re using the best pre\\\\-attentive attribute for the task, and that you’re keeping the question in the forefront of your mind. When you do, your message comes across clearly, without forcing the consumer to think too hard. If you don’t pay attention to these factors, you will create the opposite effect, and people will want to go back to tables.'}]}},\n",

It’s easy to manipulate data to support an agenda—filter heavily enough, ignore outlying data points, or use other tricks and you can eventually get the data to say what you want it to. Whenever data is used to support a political point or marketing campaign, you should look to the source to see how the data may have been manipulated. For your own work, your audience needs to know that you are showing a fair representation of the data points from the data source you are using. This level of trust will build as you continually provide fair, well\\\\-sourced, and useful data\\\\-based communications.

And showing the individual data points, instead of aggregating values to show a summary metric, can uncover new trends in the data.'}]}},\n",

This chapter has covered just a small portion of the alternate chart types available. Once you’ve grasped the basics, you can explore even more. The primary reason to use alternate chart types is that they’re eye\\\\-catching.

The chart doesn’t offer precise information but does show how the various amounts fit together. It also educates readers about how these amounts form the company’s gross and operating profit. Its unusual shape also grabs people’s attention, so it works well as a chart.

Charts are ultimately the main focus of any communication with data. However, if you concentrate only on deciding the type of chart you want to use, you’ll miss the opportunity to communicate your point to your audience even more clearly through the use of visual elements. Visual elements—such as color, size, and shape—make a massive difference to your audience’s ability to interpret your charts, which I focus on more deeply here.

Context is the circumstances in which your analysis happens, the baseline it’s based on, and the influencing factors that surround it. Context positions the points you are communicating in the audience’s minds. The cumulative effect of your visualization and its context can determine whether your audience notices, reads, or remembers your work. The key messages should jump off the page.'}]}},\n",

But single charts aren’t always the answer. When your findings are complex, trying to squeeze everything into one chart can make things confusing, convolute the key points, and confuse the message. This is even more true when you are not personally present to guide your audience through interpreting the data. The solution to this problem is to use multiple charts that each tell an individual part of the story you’ve found within the data. This allows the reader to absorb your message in chunks. You can use each chart to build your story as well as provide context.'}]}},\n",

That is why, in the past couple of decades, we have seen increasing attention being given to shortening the journey from “code committed” to “code running in front of users.” The focus is no longer just on writing good\\\\-quality code, but also on ensuring that it is swiftly and painlessly released to production.

This automation provided the much\\\\-needed technical baseline to achieve speed without compromising safety. What followed was also a challenge for software engineers to cultivate an even broader set of skills around scripting and infrastructure, and to take ownership of their work on a level that far exceeds seeing their code run on a laptop. This mindset shift isn’t constrained to only technical folks: these practices have also challenged organizations to rethink their overall culture (and structure) around the manufacture of custom software. Before them, huge batches of work were handed over from one segregated department to the next, with little to no communication between them. After them, we started seeing the emergence of cross\\\\-functional teams that are able to take care of their products from end to end.'}]}},\n",

In a sense, continuous deployment represents its logical culmination. While its predecessors automated some or even most of the code’s journey to users, continuous deployment automates it all. Even the decision to perform the final production deployment is made by a pipeline agent, not by a person. In a nutshell, continuous deployment means that a commit being pushed or merged into the main branch always results in a production deployment (provided all quality gates are green). For the first time, the journey from “code committed” to “code running in front of users” encounters no manual intervention whatsoever, and it is completed at the granularity of every commit. By removing even the very last human bottleneck, continuous deployment further reduces the software feedback loop from days or hours to mere minutes.'}]}},\n",

If production code increments can be maximally granular and lightning fast, product increments can be too. Small (or big) product decisions can be made and reversed much more easily, and made at the last possible moment—which is also the most responsible way to make such decisions.3 Sudden surprises in user behavior or requirements can be addressed immediately, with no pending deployments clogging the path to production and complicating last\\\\-minute changes. Ordinary releases themselves are broken down into slices so small that it is possible to experiment and gauge user behavior with precision, if that is what one wishes to do. Such a process takes the “responding to change” value of Agile to the extreme, and offers the narrowest possible feedback loops within the paradigm of iterative development.'}]}},\n",

As Kent Beck writes in Extreme Programming Explained, “Take everything valuable about software engineering and turn the dials to 10\\\\.”4 This process involves practices such as pair programming, where two programmers work together at one workstation (thus reviewing code continuously); test\\\\-driven development, which involves writing tests before the code (testing continuously); and continuous integration, where code changes are integrated in the main branch as frequently as possible (this one even has “continuous” in the name).'}]}},\n",

That is, until somebody asked our team to show another working version of the software, including all the new features we had been working on individually.

And so automation started to take over, and now we have pipelines automatically polling our latest code changes from version control, building artifacts from it, running all sorts of automated tests, and even performing deployments all on their own.

This lack of visibility made it much harder to diagnose issues, resulting in longer resolution times and overall increased downtime.

It also allowed teams to quickly tear down and rebuild infrastructure, which has tended to make it more immutable and predictable. To understand why, I will rely on a popular distinction in the DevOps community: the one between “pet” and “cattle” servers. Servers in on\\\\-premises data centers are often treated as “pets,” whereas servers in the cloud are more analogous to “cattle.” Pets are heavily customized servers that cannot be turned off (and like real pets, they usually belong to someone, which goes against the shared ownership principle). On the other hand, cattle servers are disposable: they can be deleted and rebuilt from scratch in case of failures, losing any customization in the process. This means immutability becomes a requirement and one\\\\-off manual changes become an antipattern, which is a great baseline for automation.'}]}},\n",

You can see it in Figure\\xa01\\\\-3. This is how it works: once code is merged or committed to trunk, a centralized server shared by the whole team will detect a change in the version control system. When it notices the change, it builds the code into an artifact. An artifact is the final “bundle” containing all the code, dependencies, and configuration necessary for the new application version to work. For example, an artifact could be a compiled binary, an archive, a .jar or .war file, or even better, a container image. Once that artifact is created, the pipeline verifies its correctness through automated tests and code inspection tools. The shared build pipeline then gives feedback to the team through information radiators, and notifies them whenever any of the checks have failed.'}]}},\n",

First and foremost, it represents a collection of ways of working to leverage the tool successfully. In the case of CD, those ways of working are centered on one simple concept: ensuring that the codebase is always in a deployable state (treat every commit as a release candidate) so that the automated pipeline can be leveraged to deploy to production at any moment. This allows teams to dramatically increase their deployment frequency. A higher deployment frequency leads to fewer and fewer lines of code between one deployment and the next, which lowers the average deployment risk. Once again, this is the “If it hurts, do it more often” principle in action.'}]}},\n",

It turns out that when we deploy more often, we enable our organization to get feedback—and adjust to the market more often too.

Through six years of research, it has confirmed that a shorter lead time for changes and a higher frequency of production deployments are reliable predictors of high performance in software development teams (and their organizations).

Every commit going through the pipeline not only will be considered deployable to production, but will actually be deployed to production. This means no more waiting around in a UAT or staging environment for manual exploratory testing, and no more human intervention to decide whether to send the changes live. The pipeline does it all, and humans can finally sit back and watch the automation do its job until the end.'}]}},\n",

This might seem daunting, but the payoff has been high for the many companies that have achieved it and are doing it successfully.

In practice, it means adding our code changes to the team’s shared, mainline branch at least once a day (or multiple times a day). Frequent integration keeps change deltas small and manageable, which is a principle that becomes imperative to follow when there is no manual verification in a preproduction environment. Hoarding thousands of changed lines on our development machines or in a branch, only to send them to production all at once, can generate chaos and disrupt users, stakeholders, and the rest of the team.

It must be acknowledged that models like Gitflow work remarkably well for open source projects on collaboration platforms such as GitHub, where developers collaborate over longer periods and communication is asynchronous by nature. However, in a cohesive team with real\\\\-time communication channels, long feature branches bring more overhead than value. In fact, they are actively disruptive.

The whole team adding to the same branch can make it more difficult to work on multiple tasks concurrently and to coordinate activities among multiple developers. Also, the burden of ensuring that developers won’t step on one another’s toes (or one another’s lines of code) needs to be addressed during the planning of day\\\\-to\\\\-day work. But this is not necessarily a negative: when working with branches, developers still risk making overlapping changes; they just wouldn’t notice these changes until merge time, when context is stale and the contested lines might have diverged even more significantly. One could say that TBD helps merging issues surface earlier, when they are easier to fix.'}]}},\n",

No matter how many elaborate code scanning tools we have, only a human can detect whether code respects functional requirements and whether it respects team agreements regarding design and structure. There are many such code design principles that go beyond trivial linting rules, and books upon books have been written about them. For example, code needs to be well partitioned, be unsurprising to read, belong to the right level of abstraction, and be conceptually aligned to its architecture. After all, if we were writing code only to be understood by machines and not by other people, we might as well ditch all of our design books and highly abstracted programming languages and go back to the ancient assembly spaghetti that our grandmothers3 had to deal with.'}]}},\n",

With pair programming, all production code is developed by a pair of developers sharing a keyboard and screen; virtual ones in the case of remote pairing. As the pair work through a task, they switch roles between typing and reasoning about the code design. As each member of the pair has to verbalize their assumptions and design ideas, they continuously debate the implementation and the requirements, therefore performing a continuous code review.'}]}},\n",

It can be equally easy to forget to sanitize our inputs correctly in every commit, opening the system up for yet another problem that will only be evident once it is in front of unknown, untrusted users.

It is faster, more efficient, more consistent, and cheaper. Automated tests can be run quickly and repeatedly, without the need for human intervention, so they are not subject to human error or variation in the way that manual tests are. Software testing of every commit is the textbook example of a repetitive and exact task that is perfectly suited to the endless patience of a computer, and it has no business being performed by human hands.

For example, tests that are appropriate to write in the first, more detailed layer might be way too granular for slower and more expensive layers, and would be redundant as well. The Swiss cheese model can also be helpful for making decisions about areas where there is an unavoidable overlap between the layers. More overlap means more protection in case the coverage is changed incorrectly in one of the other layers, but it also means a higher cost of maintenance, as changing the functionality will require updating more layers of testing.'}]}},\n",

Unit tests have been integrated into the development life cycle for a while, especially with the introduction of the “test\\\\-first” principle and test\\\\-driven development (TDD). You can read about TDD in much more depth in Test Driven Development: By Example,6 but for now I’ll summarize how it works. As shown in Figure\\xa04\\\\-4, TDD consists of three phases: writing a failing test, writing the minimum amount of code required to make that test pass, and finally refactoring the code once you are protected by the test.'}]}},\n",

The reasoning is simple. Writing failing tests before writing the code to turn them green is a reliable way to make sure that tests actually get written and coverage remains sturdy.

This forces developers to think deeply about the contracts of their classes and functions and the way they interact with one another, before they even think of their implementation. As a result, code that is written test\\\\-first is inherently testable and modular. On the other hand, writing tests after implementation is finished doesn’t always work well: a developer might find that they have a hard time injecting the necessary mocks or setting up the system for the test to execute when they didn’t design their code with testability in mind. They might have produced code that is very dense, which leads to complicated tests that need to perform a lot of assertions or setup. This added difficulty might discourage developers from writing tests after the fact, or it might lead to not covering the functionality as thoroughly as needed. Though it might seem counterintuitive, writing tests first is easier than writing them afterward.'}]}},\n",

Also, relying only on TDD to add coverage opportunistically might not be enough, as some legacy areas of the code might remain untouched for a long time or be difficult to refactor. In scenarios such as these, test coverage often needs to be worked on up front for the system to be safely changed.

Sometimes this can happen a long time after the latest deployment, as the necessary conditions for problems to surface can appear randomly. That is why it is fundamental that developers are able to get quality information about the status of the production, and that the information is highly visible in information radiators available to the whole team. Observability refers to the ability to monitor and understand the behavior of the deployed system by examining its outputs, such as logs, metrics, and traces. It represents the fundamental ability to ask new questions about the running system, affording an exploratory way to understand it. It also allows teams to identify and diagnose problems, as well as to get insights on how the system is functioning (or failing) under different conditions.'}]}},\n",

But don’t disregard business\\\\-facing metrics.

But our stakeholders cannot say the same. All they might see, from their perspective, is a loss of their chance to provide input and to block dangerous changes before it’s too late. They have no visibility into the meticulousness of the layers and layers of automation that make their approval unnecessary, and they have to trust our word as engineers. We are effectively asking them to relinquish their only power over the path to production. Given this big ask, we should strive to be empathetic to any concern they put forward.

Once the team has reached a great level of continuous delivery maturity, painstaking manual testing of every detail will start to feel redundant rather than necessary. When the team has reached that point, my experience is that even stakeholders will learn to find manual testing annoying. That is when it is easiest to suggest going one step further without triggering strong reactions.

As code goes to production more and more often, any gaps in our processes will expose themselves rapidly, and they can be addressed by the team as they come up. If we wait for our safety nets to be absolutely perfect, we might never end up taking the leap.

Finally, we will form another mental image: that of the target state of our codebase, or our intended design for the new feature.

In such situations, it can be tempting to be afraid of continuous deployment and take the “safer” route of making a big ball of changes, parking it in preproduction for manual testing, and then deploying it all at once.'}]}},\n",

Backward compatibility ensures that all the features relying on the refactoring will keep running flawlessly for users, even though the code itself is still a work in progress. However, this only holds true until our refactoring crosses the contract boundary with a database or any state store. The expand and contract pattern is not enough on its own to safely refactor live databases without loss of service or data.'}]}},\n",

You’re already familiar with the techniques around feature flagging that we use to disable unfinished features. In previous chapters, I also mentioned how most feature flag frameworks allow for sophisticated toggle ON strategies. Some of those strategies are particularly interesting because they allow developers, QA engineers, and selected stakeholders to peek under a toggle to verify the feature.

Data downtime refers to periods of time where data is missing, inaccurate, or otherwise erroneous, and it manifests in stale dashboards, inaccurate reports, and even poor decision making. The root of data downtime? Unreliable data, and lots of it. Data downtime can cost companies upwards of millions of dollars per year, not to mention customer trust.

This statistic probably comes as no surprise to you. It certainly didn’t to us. In a former life, Barr Moses served as VP of Operations at a customer success software company.

Time and again she and her team would encounter these silent and small, but potentially detrimental, issues with their data. There had to be a better way.

Up until recently, anomaly detection was considered a nice\\\\-to\\\\-have—not a need\\\\-to\\\\-have—for many data teams. Now, as data systems become increasingly complex and companies empower employees across functions to use data, it’s imperative that teams take both proactive and reactive approaches to solving for data quality. While automobiles are vastly different from data pipelines, cars and other mechanical systems have their own monitoring and anomaly detection capabilities, too. Most contemporary vehicles alert you when oil, brake fluid, gas, tire pressure, and other vital entities are lower than they should be and encourage you to take action.

First, note the `DATEADDED` column. SQL doesn’t store metadata on when individual records are added.

One of the simplest questions is, “How often is my data NULL?” In many cases, some level of incomplete data is acceptable—but if a 10% null rate turns into 90%, we’ll want to know. In statistics, we like to assume that sets of observations are drawn from baseline distributions that obey mathematical rules. Call the former “sample distributions” and the latter “true distributions.” Statistics has an observation about natural processes, called the central limit theorem, that states that distributions of independently generated random samples approach a certain distribution as the number of samples gets large.'}]}},\n",

Without a ground truth, you can’t get an error signal, in other words, the difference between what you predicted and what you should have predicted.

We’re using a simple prediction algorithm, since we turned our query into a detector by setting one model parameter X. Our algorithm says, “Any outage longer than X days is an anomaly, and we will issue an alert for it.” Even in a case as simple as this, precision, recall, and F\\\\-scores can help us! To showcase, we took the freshness outages in `EXOPLANETS` and assigned ground truth labels encoding whether each outage is a genuine incident or not. It’s impossible to calculate a model’s accuracy without some kind of ground truth, so it’s always helpful to think about how you’d generate these for your use case. Recall that there are a total of six outages lasting for more than one day in the `EXOPLANETS` table, as highlighted in the data depicted in Example\\xa04\\\\-40.'}]}},\n",

The US population hovers somewhere about 330 million. Our “accuracy,” or how correct we are on average, is 1 − (Americans with AIDS / Americans) \\\\= 1 − (1\\\\.2 million / 330 million) \\\\= 99\\\\.6%.

The onus of data trust falls on your shoulders. As companies ingest more and more data and analytics becomes part and parcel of every organizational strategy, the need for high\\\\-quality data only increases, putting pressure on data engineers, analytics engineers, and even data analysts to take ownership of this important, but challenging task. Still, it doesn’t matter how many data quality tests you run—data trust can only be achieved when the entire company buys into it. Despite the data\\\\-driven nature of nearly all teams, data organizations often shoulder the brunt of the work when it comes to tracking, enforcing, and scaling data quality initiatives.'}]}},\n",

According to a 2023 BCG study, “the volume of data generated approximately doubled from 2018 to 2021 to about 84 ZB, a rate of growth that is expected to continue.” The researchers “estimate that the volume of data generated will rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% from 2021 to 2024, reaching 149 ZB.” Companies know that they can save millions of dollars and increase revenue by gathering this data and using it to analyze the past and present and make predictions about the future—but to do that, they need a way to store all that data.'}]}},\n",

And those of us who work with data architectures need a clear understanding of how they work and what the options are. That’s where this book comes in. I have seen firsthand the result of not properly understanding data architecture concepts. One company I know of built a data architecture at the cost of $100 million over two years, only to discover that the architecture used the wrong technology, was too difficult to use, and was not flexible enough to handle certain types of data. It had to be scraped and restarted from scratch. Don’t let this happen to you!'}]}},\n",

It’s also about all the data, big or small, within your company and all the data outside your company that would be helpful to you. The data can be in any format and can be collected with any degree of regularity. So the best way to define big data is to think of it as all data, no matter its size (volume), speed (velocity), or type (variety). In addition to those criteria, there are three more factors you can use to describe data: veracity, variability, and value. Together, they’re commonly known as the “six Vs” of big data, as shown in Figure\\xa01\\\\-1.'}]}},\n",

This can be anywhere from terabytes to petabytes of data, and it can come from a wide range of sources including social media, ecommerce transactions, scientific experiments, sensor data from IoT devices, and much more. For example, data from an order entry system might amount to a couple of terabytes a day, while IoT devices can stream millions of events per minute and generate hundreds of terabytes of data a day. Variety Variety refers to the wide range of data sources and formats. These can be further broken down into structured data (from relational databases), semi\\\\-structured data (such as logs and CSV, XML, and JSON formats), unstructured data (like emails, documents, and PDFs), and binary data (images, audio, video). For example, data from an order entry system would be structured data because it comes from a relational database, while data from an IoT device would likely be in JSON format.'}]}},\n",

For example, the type, frequency, and quality of sensor data from IoT devices can vary greatly. Temperature and humidity sensors might generate data points at regular intervals, while motion sensors might generate data only when they detect motion. Value Value, the most important V, relates to the usefulness and relevance of data. Companies use big data to gain insights and make decisions that can lead to business value, such as increased efficiency, cost savings, or new revenue streams. For example, by analyzing customer data, organizations can better understand their customers’ behaviors, preferences, and needs. They can use this information to develop better targeted marketing campaigns, improve customer experiences, and drive sales.'}]}},\n",

Companies that collect and analyze large amounts of data can use it to improve their products and services, make better business decisions, and gain a competitive advantage. It can be used in a variety of ways. For example, if you use data to train machine learning algorithms, you can then use those algorithms to automate tasks, identify patterns, and make predictions. It’s a powerful resource with a transformative effect on society. The widespread use of oil powered the growth of industries and enabled new technologies, while data has led to advances in fields like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics. * It can be a source of power and influence, thanks to all of the preceding factors.'}]}},\n",

In the relational model, data is organized into tables (also known as relations, hence the name). These tables consist of rows and columns, where each row represents an entity (such as a customer or product) and each column represents an attribute of that entity (like name, price, or quantity).

If a report viewer questions the accuracy of the data, what can you tell them? The “truth” can be spread out over so many source systems that it’s difficult to trace where the data came from. In addition, some reports will give different results for the same data—for example, if two reports use complex logic to pull the data from multiple sources and the logic is updated incorrectly (or not at all). Having all the data in one central location means that the data warehouse is the single source of truth; any questions about the report data can be answered by the data warehouse.

Then other end users see the benefit the first end user got, and they want additional data from those same source systems and a few others to create their own reports. So once again the IT person quickly copies the requested data into the DW. This process repeats over and over until the DW becomes a jumbled mess of databases and tables.'}]}},\n",

Everything is running fine, and then all of a sudden, many reports start giving errors. It turns out the application went through an upgrade, installing a new version that renamed a bunch of tables and fields. So now you must go through each and every report, out of hundreds, and rename the changed tables and fields. That could take months, resulting in a lot of upset end users. Even after that, any reports that got missed might still give errors.'}]}},\n",

Reduce security concerns Without a DW, your team would need to give each end user security access to each application database they needed to use for reporting purposes.

They do this to save space and improve performance and, in some cases, to comply with regulations. Older data is usually purged yearly or monthly. On the other hand, a DW can hold all of the history, so you never have to worry about running a report for older years and not finding any data. Master data management (MDM) As you collect data from multiple source systems, many times you will need to use MDM to remove duplicate records for such things as customers, products, and assets. (See Chapter\\xa06 for a more detailed explanation of MDM.) The DW is the perfect place to perform MDM. Also, many of the MDM tools allow you to create hierarchies (for example, Company → Department → Employee), adding more value to mastering the data.'}]}},\n",

For example, an order entry application may require a customer’s birth date, and if the person entering the data does not know the customer’s birth date, they might enter a date in the future or a date more than 100 years old just to be able to complete the order. Or maybe the application does not check the accuracy of the two digits entered for a state code. There are always dozens of “holes” in the source system. You can not only clean the data in the DW, but also notify the people who maintain the applications of the holes in their systems so they can fix them.

In this case, you can run your jobs to extract the data from the source systems via ETL tools each night after the source system databases have finished updating, creating a nightly maintenance window to do all the data transfer.

The source data is provided as is, and you don’t need any additional information (for example, timestamps). Incremental extraction In incremental extraction, you’re pulling only the data that has changed since a specified time (such as the last extraction or the end of a fiscal period) instead of the whole table.

Whether you’re doing a full or an incremental extraction, there are two ways to extract the data: online and offline. In online extraction, the extraction process can connect directly to the source system to access the source tables, or it may connect to an intermediate system that stores changes to the data in a preconfigured manner (for example, in transaction logs or change tables). However, direct access to the source system is not always available. In such cases, the data is staged outside the original source system and is created by an extraction routine originating from the source system (for example, a mainframe performs an extract routine on a table and deposits the data in a folder in a filesystem). The extracted data is usually placed in a flat file that is in a defined, generic format (for example, CSV or JSON).'}]}},\n",

When data lakes first appeared, they were built on Apache Hadoop technology, and it was largely Hadoop vendors pronouncing the RDW dead. “Just put all your data in the data lake and get rid of your RDW,” they advised.

The components of data management are like gears in a complex machine; each fulfills a unique role, yet they all work synchronously to achieve a common goal. I’ll start with some of the most practical storage solutions: data marts, operational data stores, and data hubs.

There are several different types of data modeling, including relational modeling and dimensional modeling. The process involves identifying the data that needs to be stored, then creating a structured representation of that data and the relationships among the data, organized into tables and columns. Think of the tables and columns as the logical representation of the database, where the physical data stored in those tables and columns can be in a relational database product or a data lake.'}]}},\n",

This chapter is all about the first step in handling data—getting it into the system in the first place. Here, we’ll unravel some of the key ways data can be brought into different systems. I’ll kick things off by explaining two common methods, known as ETL and ELT, in a way that is easy to understand. I’ll also introduce you to a new idea called reverse ETL and explain how it flips the traditional methods on their head.'}]}},\n",

Imagine a city supermarket switching from traditional databases to a modern data warehouse (MDW). Managers can now access real\\\\-time inventory data, predict shopping trends, and streamline the shopping experience for their customers. That’s the power of an MDW. It blends the best of both worlds: the structure of RDWs and the flexibility of data lakes.'}]}},\n",

The idea behind a data lakehouse is to simplify things by using just a data lake to store all your data, instead of also having a separate relational data warehouse. To do this, the data lake needs more functionality to replace the features of an RDW. That’s where Databricks’ Delta Lake comes into play. Delta Lake is a transactional storage software layer that runs on top of an existing data lake and adds RDW\\\\-like features that improve the lake’s reliability, security, and performance. Delta Lake itself is not storage. In most cases, it’s easy to turn a data lake into a Delta Lake; all you need to do is specify, when you are storing data to your data lake, that you want to save it in Delta Lake format (as opposed to other formats, like CSV or JSON).'}]}},\n",

While the actual data sits in your data lake in a format similar to what you’re used to, the added transaction log turns it into a Delta Lake, enhancing its capabilities. But this means that anything that interacts with Delta Lake will need to support Delta Lake format; most products do, since it has become very popular.'}]}},\n",

It is very important to understand that data mesh is a concept, not a technology. It is all about an organizational and cultural shift within companies. The technology used to build a data mesh could follow the modern data warehouse, data fabric, or data lakehouse architecture—or domains could even follow different architectures.'}]}},\n",
